ocaml-monad
===========

Some common and useful monad functions for OCaml stdlib types. There are
better and more complete monad libraries for OCaml out there, like
[ocaml-mtl](https://github.com/rgrinberg/ocaml-mtl) -- for serious use, I
recommend using that instead. These are just some functions that I use a lot
and end up rewriting all the time so I stuck them in a library.
